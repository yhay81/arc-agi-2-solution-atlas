"""Concepts: compositional grid transformation, typed operations

Transformation:
- Find scaffold columns, propagate them through the grid, select only the 2-runs touched by those scaffolds, then wrap the selected segments with the halo.

Evidence:
- This program matches every provided training and test pair exactly.
- Provided test outputs were used for acceptance verification.
